1,Pediatric Airway Management (Pierre-Robin),108,"Annery Garcia-Marcinkiewicz, MD","Airway management in pediatric patients with Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS)
requires a detailed understanding of pediatric airway anatomy, which differs
significantly from adults—neonates have a larger tongue, smaller jaw
(micrognathia), anterior larynx, and floppy epiglottis, all of which are
exaggerated in PRS. These features increase the risk of airway obstruction
and difficult intubation.","1. Understand airway anatomical differences in neonates, infants, and
children compared to adults.
2. Describe developmental changes in respiratory physiology.
3. Identify predictors of a difficult pediatric or neonatal airway, including
syndromic features (e.g., Pierre Robin, Down syndrome, Goldenhar,
CHARGE).
4. Understand selection and sizing of airway equipment.
5. Understand the ASA Difficult Airway Algorithm and adaptations for
neonates and pediatric patients.",2,enabled
