                    The <strong>presenting author</strong> (person who submits the abstract and presenting at the conference) must have been involved in the completion of the research work. Presenters should be registered to attend the ACA convention by <strong>September 30, 2025</strong>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The online submission system should be used to submit all papers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A research or case report abstract that has been submitted cannot have been published as a full manuscript in any peer-reviewed journal, domestically or internationally, before the ACA conference. Please give us the courtesy of notification if your work will be accepted for publication after the submission deadline.
